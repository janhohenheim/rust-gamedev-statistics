People didn't read it, and the people who did read it weren't interested in actually playing my game. Putting my game in the newsletter isn't an advertisement for my game, it was an advertisement for the idea of making games in Rust. In all the times I put a playtesting link into the newsletter, I never got a single sign up.

This makes it kind of a bad deal for devs. It's a non-trivial amount of work, made into more work by the fact that instead of just submitting a blurb/link/image I have to clone your repo and submit a pull request.

The newsletter would be better if it contained more than just press releases - interviews, discussions, advice. That way, it would have much more value to the people who read it."
